# AMA3020-Solo-Project
Lenz Potentials code is for the effective potential graph, and has some code using rk4 seeking r=1/lambda solutions. But I broke that code (I think) as I changed the report to be in terms of r and have a new code file. The rk4 came from my Num Analysis project.

Path 2 is the code to make the orbit graphs. This time I use scipy RK45. The results are not what I expected but 3 different ways to solve I ended up with same results...

Hand writing shows some of the optical theory used and some rough comments on the effective potential that may not be explicity mentioned in the report.
